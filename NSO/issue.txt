1) Generate a NEW SSH key
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f ${NCS_DIR}/etc/ncs/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N ''

2) From $NCS_RUN (or where your ./netsim directory was created)
    $ cd ncs-run
    $ find netsim/ -type d -name ssh -exec cp ${NCS_DIR}/etc/ncs/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key* {} \;

3) manually ensure the SSH Keys from ${NCS_DIR}/etc/ncs/ssh/ were successfully copied to EACH netsim (device) ‘ssh’ directory

4) Once copy is complete and verified

a. Login to NSO
b. Perform a ‘fetch-host-keys’ command for each device

switch cli
devices device <devicename> ssh fetch-host-keys

devices sync-from

# expected to ‘sync’ all devices

5) If fails, see Step #3
